# Welcome to the **Electrical Team**

## What the electrical team does

1. Wire Harness
    * We design the wire harness from scratch this includes any schematics and CAD models.
    * We assemble the wire harness and install it on the car
    * We test and verify the whole harness to make sure that it all works
2. Data Aqusition System (DAQ) or NoTec
    * We design a fully custom PCB from scratch using KiCAD
    * We verify and test the PCB using Logic Analyzers and top end scopes
3. Sensor Integration
    * We design fully custom PCBs using KiCAD for any sensors 
    * We install any sensors that dont require custom PCBs
