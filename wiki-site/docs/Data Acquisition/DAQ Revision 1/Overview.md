# Overview

### function

The first revision of the DAQ is an STM32F4-based board that is designed to extract data from sensors and store them in a CSV format on a USB flash drive or device.

### connections
 The first revision consists of 
 
* 8 Analog Pins
* 2 SPI connections
*  10-pin SWD, 2 I2C connections
*  1 UART
*  1 USB
*  8 GPIOs
*  2 CAN connections
*  button

 This first revision contains multiple outputs to allow for flexibility for sensor choices and for flexibility in functions for the DAQ. 

### Form factor
The size of the board wasn't a major consideration for the board as this first revision was meant to be a test bench for future iterations. Leading a board that is significantly bigger than it needs to be. The board dimensions are 153.0350 by 114.300 mm or 6.025 by 4.5 inches. The board edges are curved for aesthetics as well as it makes the board less jagged around the edges. The board is also fitted with m4 screws in each corner to allow for it to be mounted into an enclosure.
