# Developer's Guide


## Getting Started

This section covers the essential tools required for the device workflow. The *OS Flashing Tools* and *Logging In* pages consists of tools you will use often in the development process. The *Starter Package*, *Developer Package*, and *Running Qt5 Apps* pages are all based on example OS images and steps provided by ST. Although on the Starter Package is essential for a brand new stm32mp1 board, I highly suggest going through these pages to understand the workflow and different possible levels of customizations behind supporting a custom Linux image.
