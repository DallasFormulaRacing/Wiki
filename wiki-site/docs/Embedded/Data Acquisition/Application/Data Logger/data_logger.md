# Data Logger

This page was last updated: *{{ git_revision_date_localized }}*

## Details

- Integrates the following support logging to a CSV file:
    - Writing and storing files
    - User input toggling
    - Receiving data from a queue
- Observes whether the storage unit is connected or ejected.
- Shares a status indicator of whether it is currently logging.

### How to Use

Be sure to provide all the dependencies:

- Any implementation of the [IFileSystem](../File%20System/index.md) interface, for managing files and block device mounting.
- Any implementation of the [IGpio]() interface, for reading a user's input to toggle data logging.
- The [CircularQueue]() and [DataPayload]() for receiving data as an input.
- A boolean that allows for observing whether the storage unit is connected or ejected.
- A boolean for sharing whether we are currently logging.

!!! example
    Using the `DataLogger`.

    ```C++
    int cppMain() {
        // Initialize DataLogger object
        DataLogger data_logger(...);

        for(;;) {
            data_logger.Run();
        }
    }
    ```

That is it! This library is kept simple to use due to the internal state machine. To get a full explanation on how to **integrate** the dependencies, go to the [Current Implementation](#current-implementation) section.

### State Machine

Internally, the `DataLogger` has the following states defined:

- `Idle`
- `Standby`
- `Logging`

This approach was taken to handle multiple cases due to the state of the storage unit being connected/ejected and providing the user control over when to log data.

This was implemented by using abstraction and inheritance. Each state inherits from `State()`, which defines that each state must have actions when entering, computing/executing, and exiting.

The `DataLogger` then has a private `SetState()` method for defining what happens at transitions:

- Perform exit actions.
- Change states.
- Perform entry actions.

Defining exit and entry actions ensures that something is performed only once, which can be beneficial for simplifying logic. No need to dedicate a boolean variable to indicate whether a particular action has been performed!

!!! info
    You can find a simple, minimalist example of implementing a state machine in this article: [Implementing a Finite State Machine in C++](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/implementing-a-finite-state-machine-in-cpp/) by Aleksandr Hovhannisyan.

    Note that in this article, instances of each state is created using a static method. In favor of a more idiomatic approach, we simply declared an instance of each state as a private variable.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Standby : Storage connected

    Standby --> Idle : Storage ejected
    Standby --> Logging : User switch enabled

    Logging --> Standby : User switch disabled
    Logging --> Idle : Storage ejected
```


#### Idle State

The default state at bootup. That is, entry actions does not occur when the device is booted.

- **Entry**: Unmount the file system.
- When the storage unit is connected, transition to the `Standby` state.
- **Exit**: Mount the file system.

#### Standby State

- When the storage unit is ejected, transition to the `Idle` state.
- When the user toggles the loging switch, and the switch's state is `HIGH`, then logging is enabled and transition to the `Logging` state.


#### Logging State

- **Entry**:
    - Create and open a new CSV file with a unique name
    - Clear the queue.
- When the storage unit is ejected, transition to the `Idle` state.
- When the user toggles the loging switch, and the switch's state is `LOW`, then logging is disabled and transition to the `Standby` state.
- If the queue is not empty, grab an instance of the data payload and record it to the CSV file.
- **Exit**: Close the CSV file.

## Current Implementation

### File System

Our [FatFs wrapper](../File%20System/fat_fs.md) fulfills the requirements of the `IFileSystem` interface. USB is used for our storage unit, so be sure to enable the following CubeMX settings described in that page's *USB in a Baremetal Environment* and *USB in an RTOS Environment* sections.

Thanks to our state machine, we only need one boolean variable to observe whether a USB flash drive is connected or ejected. Note that in C, there is no `bool` type, so we settle for using `uint8_t`.

In `USB_HOST/App/usb_host.c`:

```C
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
uint8_t usb_connected_observer = 0;

static void USBH_UserProcess  (USBH_HandleTypeDef *phost, uint8_t id)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN CALL_BACK_1 */
  switch(id)
  {
  case HOST_USER_SELECT_CONFIGURATION:
  break;

  case HOST_USER_DISCONNECTION:
  Appli_state = APPLICATION_DISCONNECT;
  usb_connected_observer = 0; // Set to false
  break;

  case HOST_USER_CLASS_ACTIVE:
  Appli_state = APPLICATION_READY;
  usb_connected_observer = 1; // Set to true
  break;

  case HOST_USER_CONNECTION:
  Appli_state = APPLICATION_START;
  break;

  default:
  break;
  }
  /* USER CODE END CALL_BACK_1 */
}
```

Then, expose this global variable in other files as necessary:

```C++
#include "usb_host.h"
extern uint8_t usb_connected_observer;
```

This variable will be used for initializing the `DataLogger`.

### User Interrupt Signal

To provide the user the ability to toggle data logging, we leverage an interrupt signal. This is more power efficient and responsive than polling. A switch is preferrable over a push-button for two reasons:

- Enabling/disabling is visually noticeable to the user.
- No need to handle button de-bouncing in neither the hardware or firmware.

To enable a GPIO pin as an interrupt, enable the pin for **GPIO_EXTIx** on CubeMX. Do not enable it as a **GPIO_Input** â€” that is for polling operations. Then, enable the interrupt signal in the NVIC interrupt table.

![GPIO Pin Enabled](./images/switch_gpio_enable.png)

![GPIO Interrupt Enabled](./images/gpio_interrupt_enable.png)

Then, configure when the interrupt signal will occur. Note that these interrupt signals can be very sensitive. So, the `DataLogger` uses a strategy of being notified when the switch is toggled. When toggled, the `DataLogger` will poll the GPIO pin to confirm whether the state is `HIGH` or `LOW`. This helps toggling to be far less sporadic and unstable.

### Integrating

The `CircularQueue` and `DataPayload` are simple to provide to the `DataLogger`. Lastly, we just need to define a boolean variable for the `DataLogger` to internally update, according to whether it is logging.

!!! example
    Integrating `DataLogger` with `FatFs` to write to a USB.

    ```C++
    // 3rd Party Libraryes and Frameworks
    #include "fatfs.h"
    extern char USBHPath[4];   // USBH logical drive path
    extern FATFS USBHFatFS;    // File system object for USBH logical drive
    extern FIL USBHFile;       // File object for USBH

    #include "usb_host.h"
    extern uint8_t usb_connected_observer; // USB connected/ejected interrupt

    std::shared_ptr<platform::GpioStmF4> gpio_callback_ptr(nullptr);

    void HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback(uint16_t GPIO_Pin) {
        gpio_callback_ptr->InterruptCallback(GPIO_Pin);
    }


    void DataLoggingThread() {
        MX_USB_HOST_Init();

        auto file_system = std::make_shared<application::FatFs>(USBHPath, USBHFatFS, USBHFile);

        auto toggle_switch = std::make_shared<platform::GpioStmF4>(GPIOF, GPIO_PIN_15);
        gpio_callback_ptr = toggle_switch;

        application::CircularQueue<application::DataPayload> queue(size);

        application::DataPayload data_payload;

        bool is_logging_flag = false;

        application::DataLogger data_logger(file_system,
                                            toggle_switch,
                                            queue,
                                            usb_connected_observer,
                                            is_logging_flag);

        for (;;) {
            data_logger.Run();
            osDelay(1000);

            if (is_logging_flag) {
                printf("Logging...\n");
            }
            else {
                printf("Either in Standby or Idle state...\n");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
